    </h2>
  Before avengers went into battle to fight thanos they picked up multiple
  extra heros to help fight thanos. One of these heroes was ant-man the game plan was to
  have ant-man crawl up thanos' butt and expand, but ant-man had some ideas of his own
  one of these was to soak in hot sauce to deal extra damage to thanos when he crawled
  up thanos' butt. As ant-man discovered electronics and hot suace don't mix.

  it, though right now it seems that the hot sauce has eaten through the suits metal
  and ant-man won't be able to shrink and enlarge before the battle
